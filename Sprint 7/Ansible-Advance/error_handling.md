# Error Handling in Ansible

Error handling is crucial in Ansible playbooks to ensure robustness and prevent unintended consequences

----
## ignore_errors 

- Purpose: Allows a task to continue execution even if it encounters an error.
- Use Cases: Useful when a non-zero return code from a command doesn't necessarily indicate a critical failure. For example, if a script returns a warning but the overall system state is still acceptable.
- ```yaml
  - name: Run a script that might produce warnings
  shell: /path/to/script.sh
  ignore_errors: true
  ```
